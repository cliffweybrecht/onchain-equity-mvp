# Governance Completion Declaration

## Status
Governance evidence and audit documentation are hereby declared complete
as of commit `16e0ecf`.

This declaration follows:
- Part 5: Governance Evidence Freeze & Deterministic Verification
- Part 6: Threat Model, Trust Assumptions, and Audit Boundary Clarification

No further governance artifacts, attestations, or guarantees are claimed
beyond those explicitly documented.

## Scope of Completion
The governance layer provides:
- Immutable, reproducible evidence of governance state
- Deterministic, offline verification tooling
- Explicit threat model and trust assumptions
- Clear audit boundaries and non-goals

The governance layer does NOT claim:
- Regulatory approval or certification
- Legal sufficiency for any jurisdiction
- Completeness beyond declared scope
- Absence of governance or operational risk

## Forward Changes
Any future changes to this repository after this declaration are:
- Out of scope for governance guarantees
- Product, issuance, or operational in nature
- Not retroactively covered by Parts 5 or 6

## Reviewer Guidance
Auditors, regulators, and reviewers should evaluate governance claims
solely within the boundaries defined by:
- `docs/threat-model.md`
- `docs/trust-and-authority.md`
- `docs/process-assumptions.md`
- `docs/audit-boundary.md`

No additional representations are implied.
